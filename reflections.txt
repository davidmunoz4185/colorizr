This project took me around 5 hours to complete.

It´s been pretty interesting to create a gem from the beginning.

Now I know there is high community to share any code you can create.

I also feel happy due to I already know how to create method based on the parameteres you pass in
and how powerful is if you want to parameter these methods.

How does your gem take advantage of Ruby’s metaprogramming capabilities?

By the following causes:

Updating String Class to add new methods.
Using "class_eval" to implement "create_colors" method.
Using "send" to call each of the different color methods.
